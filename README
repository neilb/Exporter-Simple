NAME
    Exporter::Simple - Easier set-up of module exports

SYNOPSIS
      package MyExport;
      use base 'Exporter::Simple';

      my @bar : Exportable(vars) = (2, 3, 5, 7);
      my $foo : Exported(vars)   = 42;
      my %baz : Exported         = (a => 65, b => 66);

      sub hello : Exported(greet,uk)   { "hello there" }
      sub askme : Exportable           { "what you will" }
      sub hi    : Exportable(greet,us) { "hi there" }

      # meanwhile, in a module far, far away
      use MyExport qw(:greet);
      print hello();
      $baz{c} = 67;

DESCRIPTION
    This module, when subclassed by a package, allows that package to define
    exports in a more concise way than using "Exporter". Instead of having
    to worry what goes in @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS, you can use
    two attributes to define exporter behavior. This has two advantages: It
    frees you from the implementation details of "Exporter", and it keeps
    the export definitions where they belong, with the subroutines and
    variables.

    The attributes provided by this module are:

    "Exported"
        Indicates that the associated subroutine or global variable should
        be automatically exported. It will also go into the ":all" tag (per
        the rules of %EXPORT_TAGS), as well as any tags you specify as
        options of this attribute.

        For example, the following declaration

          sub hello : Exported(greet,uk)   { ... }

        will cause "hello()" to be exported, but also be available in the
        tags ":all", ":greet" and ":uk".

    "Exportable"
        Is like "Exported", except that the associated subroutine or global
        variable won't be automatically exported. It will still go to the
        ":all" tag in any case and all other tags specified as attribute
        options.
