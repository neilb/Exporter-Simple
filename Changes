Revision history for Perl extension Exporter::Simple.

0.12  Tue Jul  3 13:07:30 CEST 2001
	- Changed source filter to insert lexical-inspecting code
	  at the end of the calling module
	- Added documentation effectively saying 'our attributes
	  will be in 5.8.0, so we're not doing any fancy workarounds
	  here'

0.11  Thu Jun  7 14:00:35 2001
	- Added source filter to rename custom import() routine,
	  so no special name is necessary

0.10  Tue Jun  6 18:37:20 2001
	- Added exportable lexicals and support for a custom _import
	  routine. Also export() and exportable() to manually export
	  globals (as they can't take attributes).

0.02  Wed May 30 13:53:50 2001
	- Added tests, documentation. Renamed 'Export' to 'Exported'
	  and 'ExportOk' to 'Exportable' (Damian's idea)

0.01  Wed May 23 12:57:49 2001
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-XAn Exporter::Simple
